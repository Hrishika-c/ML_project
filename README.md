In this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model to categorize product reviews from an e-commerce platform. My goal was to accurately classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral to provide businesses with valuable customer insights.

To achieve this, I followed a structured process:

Data Collection: I gathered a large dataset of product reviews from various online sources.
Preprocessing: I cleaned the text data by removing unnecessary characters, tokenizing words, removing stop words, and stemming to prepare it for analysis.
Feature Extraction: I used CountVectorizer to convert the text into numerical data.
Model Training: I split the data into training and testing sets and trained Logistic Regression and Na√Øve Bayes models, choosing them for their effectiveness in classification.
Evaluation: I evaluated the models using a confusion matrix and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
My results showed that the model performed well in sentiment categorization, demonstrating its ability to provide businesses with actionable insights from customer feedback.
